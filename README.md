# Intro to FinTech Assignment

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

  * Social Finance, Inc. (SoFi)

* When was the company incorporated?

* Who are the founders of the company?

  * Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan and Ian Brady (i)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? 

  * Four students met up and thought of more affordable options for other students to pay for their education. They met with alumni and initially got $2 million to pilot the program. (i)

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

  * Initially they were being funded by alumnus. (i) Since then they have gotten investors. They have raised a total of $2.5 Billion through 14 rounds of investments. (ii)


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

  * Initially they were helping students pay for tuition through a low interest rate. Now they are an all in one financial entity. Providing services like a major bank without the brick and mortar restriction. (i)

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

  * They are targeting the everyday consumer, before they were targeting student loans of professionals poised to make lots of money. (vi) They're treating their customers as humans during the loan application process instead of a number as most traditional banks would. They provide you a loan when others would reject. They also don't pull your credit scores to identify a rate for you. (viii)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

  * Viewport Meta, Iphone/Mobile Compatible, Google Analytics (iii) jQuery, Amazon EC2, Redis, Amazon S3, Kafka, Amazon RDS, Tableau, Jupyter, Android Studio. (ix)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
 
  * Wealth Management, Lending, Personal Finance, Robo-advising.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

  * Alternative lending - with the addition of technology, we are capable of lending or borrowing from other consumers and not restricted to banks. Money Transfer - with the introduction of Zelle and CashApp, we're able to transfer money from one individual to another without writing a check and handing it over. Mobile Applications - With mobile applications from a bank, we're essentially able to do everything at a brick and mortar location in the comfort of our own home. (v)

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

  * Avant, Lending Club, Upstart Network, LendingTree, Common Bond.(iv) Ant Financial


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  * By providing a refreshing take on banks, SoFi has introduced a new take on what we believed to be banking. By providing an all encompassing virtual experience when refinancing your student loans, they've changed the way major banks have done business in the past. Not only is SoFi focused on loans, but they're also focused on creating a community of early professionals that help one another out. (vii)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

  * Application approval rate, customer acquisition cost, abandoned loan rate, average origination value.(xi) SoFi's performance on the metrics aren't readily available to the public. However SoFi did publish a blog about their 2019 year in review. In the blog they focused mainly on the customers and what their financial goals were and how SoFi helped out. Showcasing the personal interaction that they pride themselves on. (xii)
  
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

  * Relatively well. Within the original focus group of Millenials, SoFi has 6.5% of the market compared to LendKeys' 4.6% and CommonBonds' 2.7%. They also edge out CommonBond and LendKey when it comes to Gen Xers and Boomers when deciding to borrow money to go back to school. (x)


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

  * I would advise to have an in person chat feature on the home page or possibly through the app. Looking at the homepage they have quite a lot of offerings and having a chat feature where you're able to speak to someone could help make the decision of switching over easier. Or possibly have a virtual set up ready. With the introduction of the Hololens 2 by Microsoft, SoFi could potentially create a virtual environment where customers can go and ask questions about their different offerings. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

  * SoFi has mentioned in the past that they pride themselves on evaluating each application on a case by case scenario. Having a chat feature would further their claims about having a relationship with the individual and building a community. Instead of viewing applicants as a number. With the virtual environment, applicants can put a face to a name and feel more comfortable about selecting SoFi as their lending provider. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

  * Web-based application where someone can be online to chat with. Gyroscopes, motion sensors, projections, would be some needed technology to create a virtual environment. The applicants would only need to acquire a Hololens 2 or similar device to be able to hook up to the internet and connect virtually.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

  * These technologies are needed to communicate virtually.
